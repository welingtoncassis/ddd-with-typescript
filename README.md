## Entity vs Model

- Entity is part of the domain layer, in which are the business rules
- Model is parte of the infra layer, in which are an database api

## Domain Services

- It is a stateless Operation that fulfills a domain-specific task. We create a Domain Service when the operation doesn't make sense to be in an entity or isn't the entity's responsibility.
